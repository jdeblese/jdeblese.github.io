## Crassula Perforata

Here's a plant I found in many garden centers in Belgium. Grows fast, roots easily from cuttings, and will even shoot aerial roots when it's humid. It branches somewhat, and may occasionally topple under its own weight. Given enough sun it'll turn slightly red.

It looks to me like a *crassula perforata*, but I can't be sure and there was no name on the pot.
