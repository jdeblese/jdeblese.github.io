it’s still not entirely clear how this is supposed to work, mostly on the

<div class="e-content"><p>I dive sidemount with a manifolded setup, and connect my first stages to the
manifold through quick-disconnects. I’ve recently switched to Swagelok QC-6 QDs
(another common alternative is Omniswivel), and was looking to attach some stem
and body protectors to my setup. Below is how I ended up attaching a loop of
cave line to a SS-QC6-SP.</p>
<p>There appear to be two variants of the SS-QC6-SP: one with a hole through the
side of the top, with a loop of steel rope through it, and one with a length of
steel rope riveted to the top surface. To attach cave line to the latter, drill
out the rivet head, push out the body using a hammer and awl, and thread a loop
through the resulting hole with knots on both sides to hold it in place. This
is easier to do with the cap removed from the body, but be prepared to use
force as there was thread lock on the set I received.</p>

</figure>
<p>The above image was captured with the same setup as below: 1 MSPS ADC w/ 500
kHz antialiasing filter, downsampled to 100 kSPS. A switchable bypass was added
around the CIC filter, however, allowing me to view a simple downsample without
filtering.</p>
<p>On the left, darker, is the measurement with CIC enabled, and on the right with
CIC bypassed. As you can see, signals 2, 4 and 5 are far stronger coming
through the bypass, suggesting they are higher frequencies aliased down into
this range. The scale of the spectrogram is 20 dB, so with CIC lobes as high as
16 dB this is perfectly possible. On the other hand, signal 1 seems unaffected,
however, so likely originates there. Signal 3 is hard to judge: it looks like a
faint VLF signal with a stronger higher-frequency signal - the one that
suddenly strengthens - aliased to just next to it.</p>
<p>Next step is to implement a multi-stage CIC filter with equalizer to further
reduce the aliasing. It might also be worth trying to pull out some of these
signals individually, aliased or not, as it looks like 4 might be modulated
with something.</p>

<div class="e-content"><p>As an experiment in VLF reception and SDR techniques, I hooked up a PmodAD1 to
my FPGA and started capturing. The short wire antenna goes into a JFET
amplifier, which is AC-coupled into the ADC. The AD1 can sample at 1 MSPS, but
as I’m reading data over a serial link limited to 1 MBaud, I use a CIC filter
to downsample the ADC’s output. On the PC, a python script performs an FFT and
draws a running spectrogram using SDL2.</p>

with incoming data - but it’s good enough to broadcast sensor data over my
network. I’m looking forward to being able to hack the firmware, however.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I’ve got an ATMega328p that runs at 18.432 MHz on only
3.3 V, using an external 3.3 V crystal oscillator. That’s out of spec according

<div class="e-content"><p>A company in China has produced a compact WiFi module for $5, available on
various sites and featured on Hack-A-Day. Documentation is in Chinese, but
there’s an active group trying to figure out how to flash the firmware to
customize the microcontroller software. As shipped, the module is flashed with
an AT command set that provides an IP stack, including DHCP and ICMP, that
offers up to four TCP or UDP connections. I’ve gotten mine working and
communicating, attached to my FPGA development board acting as a serial
pass-through.</p>
<p>Note that some of the translate documentation available online is already
obsolete. The baudrate was recently upped to 115200, for instance, and the
older docs don’t mention the reset pin that must be held high. I’ve also found
that if the board is in AP mode, a reset is required before it will switch to
station mode.</p>

implemented its communication protocol on my Nexys 3 to run some tests. It
appears that this chip is very sensitive to noise, either through the power
supply or coupled to the analog in line, as I’m getting very glitchy
measurements: with <em>analog_in</em> connected to Vcc/2, the output is 0x800 ± 0x20,
with every 20th measurement or so suddenly dropping to zero. This is when
powered off of an external 3.3 v linear regulator, as the results are far worse
when the Nexys’s 3.3 v supply is used.</p>
<p>The variation of the input measurement is understandable and not a huge issue,
as I expect that can be reduced with careful layout of the final board. The
sudden drops to zero are more worrying, however.</p>

<div class="e-content"><p>Summary: to connect to RouterOS from a Chromebook, use the ONC file below but
leaving out the “CompLZO” parameter completely.</p>
<p>Problem solved, thanks to some
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=397774">help</a> from the
Chromium guys. It seems that if the OpenVPN <em>comp-lzo</em> option is set, an extra
byte is added to the packet even if this option is set to <em>no</em>. RouterOS
documentation states that LZO is not supported, but this means that the option
must be left out completely because otherwise the IP header will be received
shifted by one byte. I haven’t been able to find a breakdown of what exactly
the <em>comp-lzo</em> option changes in the OpenVPN packet, however.</p>
<p>A quick search showed that others have also run into this behavior, for
instance <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=152214">this</a> DD-WRT
thread. Another <a href="https://forums.openvpn.net/topic10067.html">thread</a> on the

the configuration and pushing of options and won’t be solved before version 3.</p>

<div class="byline"><a class="dt-published u-url" href="#20140724_chromeos_routeros_vpn">2014/07/24</a>
 - <a class="p-author h-card" href="http://www.thescrapyard.org">Jan-willem De Bleser</a>
</div>
<div class="e-content"><p>I’ve been trying to connect my Chromebook to a Mikrotik box via VPN, and
thougth I’d share some of my debugging results. This is not meant to be an
OpenVPN tutorial - there are plenty of those around - but will merely give what
is needed to make this particular setup work.</p>
<p>The main issue is that it seems that <strong>remote-cert-tls</strong> has been enabeled on
ChromeOS, which means that the server key must have the proper <em>Key Usage</em> and
<em>Extended Key Usage</em> extensions. Using the RouterOS
<strong>sign-certificate-request</strong> command will not set these, so a separate setup is
required. A certificate request can be created anywhere, including on RouterOS,
but to sign the key using OpenSSL you need to issue a command along the lines
of:</p>
<pre><code>openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -extensions v3_req -extfile ext.cnf -out server.crt
</code></pre>
<p>Note the <strong>-extensions</strong> and the <strong>-extfile</strong> arguments (thanks to
<a href="http://www.mytidbitz.com/?p=109">emeka</a>). The first tells x509 to go looking
in the <em>v3_req</em> section of <em>ext.cnf</em>, which is a standard OpenSSL configuration
file. Based on various online comments
(<a href="https://forums.openvpn.net/topic7484.html#p9220">here</a>, for instance), make
sure your <em>ext.cnf</em> file contains at least the following:</p>
<pre><code>[ v3_req ]

keyUsage = critical, digitalSignature, keyAgreement
extendedKeyUsage = critical, serverAuth
</code></pre>
<p>The specification for these two lines can be found
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/x509v3_config.html#Key_Usage_">here</a>. The
two <em>critical</em> arguments may not be necessary, but I haven’t tested that.</p>
<p>The second issue is that ChromeOS by default uses UDP for OpenVPN connections,
while RouterOS only supports TCP. This can be circumvented by creating an ONC
file to add the VPN connection rather than using the GUI under settings. I’ve
had some luck with the following (anonymized) file, the source of which I’ve
forgotten:</p>
<pre><code>{

        }
    ]
}

document for a reference. The X509 certificate should be the PEM certificate
all on one line. Import this file via <em>chrome://net-internals/#chromeos</em>, and
you should have a new VPN connection configured.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to add and your CA certificate under Settings/Certificates, and
configure RouterOS as described <a href="http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/OpenVPN">here</a>.
This gets me as far as creating a successful connection, with both sides
assigned an IP, but neither side able to ping the other. I have yet to figure
out where the traffic is disappearing to.</p>

</div>
<div class="e-content"><p>Just acquired a Metcal soldering station, and the thing’s a real luxury
compared to what I’m used to. It soldered a connector to a Star MCPCB and then
some 1206 SMD capacitors to another PCB without a hitch.</p>
<p>For people unfamiliar with these (as I was until recently) they’re soldering
irons that use RF @ 13.56 MHz to directly heat the tip of the iron. It’s a
fixed-temperature system, with a heater welded to the tip so power transfer is
excellent. Apparently it can’t go out of calibration, and thanks to the good
power transfer you’d only really need temperature control if you were soldering
thermally sensitive components. The major downside is that the tips, or
“cartridges”, are noticeably more expensive than other tips.</p>
<p>A new MX station is very expensive, but you can get a second-hand setup for a
fairly reasonable price. The old RFG-30 supplies used in the STSS stations are
on eBay for $50–100, and they’re compatible with the modern MX hand-pieces and
cartridges. I got a supply from an STSS-002 and a new MX-H1-AV kit (hand-piece
and holder) and can confirm that they work together. The supply hums a bit, but
apparently that’s normal, and in fact you can tell how much power the tip’s
drawing by the intensity of the hum.</p>
<p>All in all, a nice piece of hardware.</p>
