Just wanted to share an example of why antialiasing matters.

The above image was captured with the same setup as below: 1 MSPS ADC w/ 500
kHz antialiasing filter, downsampled to 100 kSPS. A switchable bypass was added
around the CIC filter, however, allowing me to view a simple downsample without
filtering.

On the left, darker, is the measurement with CIC enabled, and on the right with
CIC bypassed. As you can see, signals 2, 4 and 5 are far stronger coming
through the bypass, suggesting they are higher frequencies aliased down into
this range. The scale of the spectrogram is 20 dB, so with CIC lobes as high as
16 dB this is perfectly possible. On the other hand, signal 1 seems unaffected,
however, so likely originates there. Signal 3 is hard to judge: it looks like a
faint VLF signal with a stronger higher-frequency signal - the one that
suddenly strengthens - aliased to just next to it.

Next step is to implement a multi-stage CIC filter with equalizer to further
reduce the aliasing. It might also be worth trying to pull out some of these
signals individually, aliased or not, as it looks like 4 might be modulated
with something.
