Looks like some people over at [IndieWeb.org](https://indieweb.org) are trying
to get the ball rolling on distributed social networking and such. Looks
interesting enough to give a shot, so I've reformatted this to be a
[h-entry](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry) post, and added a
[h-card](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card) to the bottom of this page.

Update 5/4: I've got an h-card, a rel=me link, and indieauth set up as an auth
provider. I've got these posts tagged as entries within an h-feed. However,
it's still not entirely clear how this is supposed to work, mostly on the
client/consumer side of things. How does one put together a feed out of
individual people's content? Allowing comments on here would be interesting
too, although probably not obvious considering the pages are static html.

Currently working on getting auth (via <https://indieauth.com>), microsub,
webmentions (via <https://webmention.io>) and such up and running, as maybe
that'll make thing clearer.

The webmentions system at <https://telegraph.p3k.io> doesn't seem to like twitter
as a webmention source, unfortunately. <a

class="u-syndication">Tweeted</a> a link to this post but Telegraph doesn't
detect the webmention, possibly due to Twitter not having any microformat tags?
