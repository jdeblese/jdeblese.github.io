As an experiment in VLF reception and SDR techniques, I hooked up a PmodAD1 to
my FPGA and started capturing. The short wire antenna goes into a JFET
amplifier, which is AC-coupled into the ADC. The AD1 can sample at 1 MSPS, but
as I'm reading data over a serial link limited to 1 MBaud, I use a CIC filter
to downsample the ADC's output. On the PC, a python script performs an FFT and
draws a running spectrogram using SDL2.

So, the question now is: are these signals artefacts of my filter, the
emissions of my FPGA, or (hopefully) something external to my measurement
setup?
