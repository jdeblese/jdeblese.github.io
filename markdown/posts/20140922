A lightning storm hit today, so I recorded a few strikes. The spectrogram is a
256-point FFT at 100 kSPS, but with every second FFT discarded due to a lack of
processing power - otherwise the computer would not have been able to keep up
with the radio. The CIC filter in the downsampler has a null at 50 kHz.
