A company in China has produced a compact WiFi module for $5, available on
various sites and featured on Hack-A-Day. Documentation is in Chinese, but
there's an active group trying to figure out how to flash the firmware to
customize the microcontroller software. As shipped, the module is flashed with
an AT command set that provides an IP stack, including DHCP and ICMP, that
offers up to four TCP or UDP connections. I've gotten mine working and
communicating, attached to my FPGA development board acting as a serial
pass-through.

Note that some of the translate documentation available online is already
obsolete. The baudrate was recently upped to 115200, for instance, and the
older docs don't mention the reset pin that must be held high. I've also found
that if the board is in AP mode, a reset is required before it will switch to
station mode.

Anyway, interesting little device.
