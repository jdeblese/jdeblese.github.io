Linux Jail on FreeNAS 13.1

In an attempt to get [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) working in a [FreeNAS](https://www.freenas.org/)
jail, I installed a Linux runtime in a FreeBSD jail. This is very unsupported,
but is possible in conjunction with the linux compatibility layer.

My first attempt followed the instructions from
[here](https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/setting-up-a-debian-linux-jail-on-freebsd.68434/)
and [here](https://iocage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debian.html).
Installing Devuan worked (a slight scare during apt where it rebooted my machine, but no harm), but the jail had no
network access just as in
[this](https://www.ixsystems.com/community/threads/rebooted-iocage-jails-have-no-network-access-and-old-tricks-arent-fixing-this-anymore.70374/)
post. Assuming it was a Debian issue, I tried again with a manual install of
Slackware, but encountered the same issues. It's possible to get an ethernet
interface in the jail by enabling vnet, creating an epair interface, and
setting the vnet_interface property of the jail (see
[here](https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/setting-up-a-debian-linux-jail-on-freebsd.68434/page-2#post-447831)),
but trying to set an address results in an error:

```
root@slackware:/# ifconfig epair27b 172.22.0.27
SIOCSIFADDR: Invalid argument
SIOCSIFFLAGS: Invalid argument
```

Here's the workaround: since all this is being run with the BSD kernel and via
the compatibility layer, it's possible to mix Linux and FreeBSD executables, so
copy over the following files:

```
/sbin/ifconfig
/sbin/route
/lib/libc.so.7
/lib/libjail.so.1
/lib/libm.so.5
/libexec/ld-elf.so.1
```

It's then possible to manually set an address. Not all tools work - ping gets
into an infinite loop, for instance - but the package manager works, and that
was enough for my purposes.

As far as getting .NET working in the jail, it produces the same error as it does in a FreeBSD jail. 
Appears to be due to a missing syscall "membarrier".
