Summary: to connect to RouterOS from a Chromebook, use the ONC file below but
leaving out the "CompLZO" parameter completely.

Problem solved, thanks to some
[help](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=397774) from the
Chromium guys. It seems that if the OpenVPN *comp-lzo* option is set, an extra
byte is added to the packet even if this option is set to *no*. RouterOS
documentation states that LZO is not supported, but this means that the option
must be left out completely because otherwise the IP header will be received
shifted by one byte. I haven't been able to find a breakdown of what exactly
the *comp-lzo* option changes in the OpenVPN packet, however.

A quick search showed that others have also run into this behavior, for
instance [this](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=152214) DD-WRT
thread. Another [thread](https://forums.openvpn.net/topic10067.html) on the
OpenVPN forums suggests they are aware of the issue, but that it's related to
the configuration and pushing of options and won't be solved before version 3.
