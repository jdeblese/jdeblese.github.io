  <h1>RF Power Reference</h1>
  <hr noshade>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Based on W1GHz's board, in QST April 2007 and <a href="http://www.w1ghz.org/small_proj/small_proj.htm">here</a>. I redesigned the board
	for SMD components and using coplanar waveguide. A comparator was also added to buffer the oscillator output.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Schematic and board were done in <a href="http://www.cadsoftusa.com">EAGLE</a>.
	Board is currently being prototyped by <a href="http://oshpark.com">OSH Park</a>.
	Measurements will be done as soon as the boards are ready.
	Sources will be made available once I'm happy with the board, or upon request.
