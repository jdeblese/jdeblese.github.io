</div>
<div class="e-content"><p>My “networking closet” was a mess but is too narrow for a 19” rack, so I built
a 10” rack out of McMaster t-slot rails (<a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/128/2108">5537T35</a>) and hardware. It’s
mounted to the wall using an L-shaped foot (<a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/128/2120">5537T571</a>) at the lower left
and a rearwards-extending segment of rail at the upper left, so quite sturdy.
The <a href="https://www.pennelcomonline.com/en/Penn-Elcom-5U-Full-Hole-Rack-Strip-with-Square-Holes-2mm008-R08632MM-05/m-6533.aspx">5U rack strips</a> are attached unmodified using slot hardware, on
matching-length t-slot rails mounted such that the spacing between them can be
adjusted: not all “half-rack” hardware is exactly 10”, I’ve found.</p>
<p>No space on the rack to mount power supplies, servers, or much in the way of
cable organizers, but at least the network hardware is now accessible and
somewhat organized.</p>
<p>Rack hardware, for reference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mikrotik RB450Gx4 (router, DHCP, DNS, etc…)</li>
<li>QNAP QSW-2104-2S (2.5GBASE-T switch, for NAS and office workstation)</li>
<li>Mikrotik CSS610-8G-2S+IN (1GBASE-T switch, wanted a POE model but it didn’t have SFP+)</li>
<li>Uxcell 12-port keystone panel</li>
<li>UTT S1042GP (POE switch, for APs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Below the rack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azulle Byte3 (NUC as lightweight FreeBSD server)</li>
<li>Supermicro SYS-5029A-2TN4 (TrueNAS)</li>
</ul>
<p>The in-wall cabling for APs (Ruckus R500 and Mikrotik wAP ac) and for my home
office terminates on the 12-port patch panel. The panel also connects to the printer
and to a HomeSeer RPI HomeTroller V3.</p>

<div class="e-content"><p>TL/DR: you can run pavucontrol under systemd-run to interact with a pulseadio
server spawned by a system service.</p>
<p>I run <a href="https://www.musicpd.org/">Music Player Daemon</a> on my NAS and stream the
output via <a href="https://roc-streaming.org/">Roc Toolkit</a> to multiple clients
scattered around the house. My first client was a NUC running
<a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a>, but I wanted somthing more efficient so
picked up a few Raspberry Pi’s, and for simplicity stuck with the official
linux distribution, running systemd. It was easy enough to create a unit
file to run roc-recv as a system service, but systemd isolates services and
user sessions in silos, with as a result that commands such as pactl and
pavucontrol couldn’t connect to the roc-spawned pulse server. The solution is to
use systemd-run to run pa* as a system process.</p>

<div class="byline"><a class="dt-published u-url" href="#20210326_bereniceRepair">2021/03/26</a>

</div>
<div class="e-content"><p>I own a <a href="https://www.luceplan.com/products/berenice-table">Luceplan Berenice D12 LED</a> table lamp. Very nice lamp
that has served me well for many years as both a desk and readling light, but recently it began to flicker.
The lamp has a warning that the bulb is not user-replaceable and the company didn’t respond to my email,
so I took the lamp head apart to see what was up. The LED driver in the lamp head is a straightforward <a href="https://www.st.com/en/power-management/l5970d.html">L5970D</a> step-down converter
set up for a constant 460 mA through a square ~1.5 cm LED. The flickering was due to
rows of the 5x5 emitter grid shutting off intermittently once warmed up, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>The existing passive components appeared to be in order so I removed the existing unmarked bulb (glued in place, twist to remove)
and replaced it with a <a href="https://www.cree.com/led-components/media/documents/XLampCXA1507.pdf">Cree CXA1507</a>.
The D12 heatsink has a slight recess for the LED and the Cree is slightly too large, so it’s to be determined
if the thermal connection is good enough to prevent it from overheating. However, the driver voltage and light output is stable and the
Cree radiation pattern looks to work well with the lens cover of the D12, so thus far the repair is a success.</p>

</div>
<div class="e-content"><p>TLDR: If you call into long-duration foreign functions from in Haskell and those
functions are marked <code>unsafe</code>, other Haskell threads will be paused a la Python’s GIL.</p>
<p>Haskell foreign function calls imported via <code>foreign import ccall</code> can be marked as either
<code>safe</code> or <code>unsafe</code>, with complex performance implications. To quote the <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/interfacing-with-c-the-ffi.html#id655194">Typed Pointers</a>
section of Real Word Haskell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When making a foreign import declaration, we can optionally specify a
“safety” level to use when making the call, using either the safe or unsafe
keyword. A safe call is less efficient, but guarantees that the Haskell
system can be safely called into from C. An “unsafe” call has far less
overhead, but the C code that is called must not call back into Haskell. By
default foreign imports are “safe”, but in practice it is rare for C code to
call back into Haskell, so for efficiency we mostly use “unsafe” calls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, to quote  <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~trebla/personal/haskell/ghc-conc-ffi.xhtml">GHC Threading and FFI</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is how GHC does it. So an OS thread with a capability is happily
churning along Haskell threads. Suddenly one unbound Haskell thread
safe-calls C. (The story of the bound case is in the next section.) This
Haskell thread is suspended, this OS thread loses its capability and runs the
C code, and some other OS thread gains the capability and picks up the other
Haskell threads. Everyone is happy.</p>
<p>An unsafe C call does not involve a transfer of capability. Therefore many
other Haskell threads are put on hold as collateral damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This behaviour caused me a fair bit of grief, mainly because I was entirely
unaware of the nature of what was going on.  I’ve been working on some SDR
software in Haskell, and the
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rtlsdr">rtlsdr</a> package imports all its
calls as <code>unsafe</code>, such that data processing cannot be done concurrently with a
call to <code>readSync()</code> due to the capabilities effects discussed above. Modifying
the library to use safe imports makes it possible to run the <code>readSync()</code> in a
separate OS thread and pass the data via MVar, allowing real-time processing.</p>

<div class="e-content"><p>I ran into all sorts of EFI troubles when installing FreeBSD 12.1 to an ASRock

boot partition on the new install, and then stopping with various different

<p>The solution: after installing, reboot using the install media, drop into a
shell, and use efibootmgr to add an EFI entry for the newly-installed disk.</p>
<p>On a side note, updating the BIOS to 2.0 doesn’t help either, but also means
the system will no longer boot without a monitor attached… 😑</p>

</div>
<div class="e-content"><p>I’ve made another attempt at getting Jellyfin to run in a jail (see
<a href="#20200313_linjail">2020/03/13</a>), since there’s been progress on getting the
.NET core to build on FreeBSD (see
<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/issues/1139">github</a>). However,
although the bootstrap SDK starts in a FreeBSD jail, it still fails with
0x8007001F. Checking with <em>truss</em>,  it appears to be failing on an mlock of 4
KiB.</p>
<p>First point: it may be possible to get this running in the base FreeNAS
install. The SDK will run .NET executables in the base install if you set an
LD_LIBRARY_PATH pointing to the missing libraries (find them in a jail) and if
you increase <em>vm.max_wired</em> to allow for the mlock. However, building now fails
with a .NET stack trace, one which I haven’t yet tried to debug.</p>
<p>Second point: since mlock works in base, shouldn’t it be possible to have it
work in a jail? Iocage has a jail property <em>allow_mlock</em>, but it seems this is
a no-op under 11.3, and only actually supported in FreeBSD 12. Thus, memory
locking will not work under the current stable version of FreeNAS.</p>

</div>
<div class="e-content"><p>In an attempt to get <a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a> working in a <a href="https://www.freenas.org/">FreeNAS</a>
jail, I installed a Linux runtime in a FreeBSD jail. This is very unsupported,
but is possible in conjunction with the linux compatibility layer.</p>
<p>My first attempt followed the instructions from
<a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/setting-up-a-debian-linux-jail-on-freebsd.68434/">here</a>
and <a href="https://iocage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debian.html">here</a>.
Installing Devuan worked (a slight scare during apt where it rebooted my machine, but no harm), but the jail had no
network access just as in
<a href="https://www.ixsystems.com/community/threads/rebooted-iocage-jails-have-no-network-access-and-old-tricks-arent-fixing-this-anymore.70374/">this</a>
post. Assuming it was a Debian issue, I tried again with a manual install of
Slackware, but encountered the same issues. It’s possible to get an ethernet
interface in the jail by enabling vnet, creating an epair interface, and
setting the vnet_interface property of the jail (see
<a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/setting-up-a-debian-linux-jail-on-freebsd.68434/page-2#post-447831">here</a>),
but trying to set an address results in an error:</p>
<pre><code>root@slackware:/# ifconfig epair27b 172.22.0.27
SIOCSIFADDR: Invalid argument
SIOCSIFFLAGS: Invalid argument
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s the workaround: since all this is being run with the BSD kernel and via
the compatibility layer, it’s possible to mix Linux and FreeBSD executables, so
copy over the following files:</p>
<pre><code>/sbin/ifconfig
/sbin/route
/lib/libc.so.7
/lib/libjail.so.1
/lib/libm.so.5
/libexec/ld-elf.so.1
</code></pre>
<p>It’s then possible to manually set an address. Not all tools work - ping gets
into an infinite loop, for instance - but the package manager works, and that
was enough for my purposes.</p>
<p>As far as getting .NET working in the jail, it produces the same error as it does in a FreeBSD jail.
Appears to be due to a missing syscall “membarrier”.</p>

<p>I need a VPN exiting in Europe and for various reasons decided to roll my
own. Initially set one up running FreeBSD 12, but was getting a miserly 20 kbps
upload speed. It turns out a 1-CPU droplet is not fast enough to run ipfw and
natd, or at least not without tuning that’s beyond my level of expertise. I am
fairly familiar with RouterOS, however, so installed that on a droplet and did
some speed tests: with basic filtering, nat, and using
<a href="https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:IP/Fasttrack">fasttrack</a> to speed up the
firewall, I’m getting ~ 3 Mbps in both directions to the US with minimal CPU
load on the droplet.</p>
<p>Pros: speed, low cpu usage, powerful networking interface (if you like RouterOS)</p>
<p>Cons: not technically a supported OS, only supports TCP-based OpenVPN connections</p>

<div class="e-content"><p>Got a bike a few years back that I’m mostly very happy with (Fairdale
Weekender), except that I prefer the upright sitting position of a European city
bike to the more forward-leaning posture that the Archer handlebar put me in. I
finally decided to replace the handlebar with something more to my liking and
ended up purchasing the Nitto Bosco on a 105 mm Nitto HiRiser stem, which puts me
almost upright. Didn’t much like the trigger shifter on this setup, so I
switched it out for a bar-end friction shifter instead.</p>
<p>One caveat: The SunRace R90 rear bar-end shifter is not entirely compatible with
the SRAM X5 9-speed rear derailer. The throw of the shifter is not enough to
pull the X5 from lowest to highest, so I’ve had to set it to shift from 2nd at
minimum to 8th at maximum. We’ll see how well that works for commuting over the
next few weeks - whether I miss having the full range, and/or whether I should
switch it to 1-7 or 3-9.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I’ll consider switching out the cassette to a 7-speed or switch to a
different derailer.</p>

<div class="e-content"><p>Looks like some people over at <a href="https://indieweb.org">IndieWeb.org</a> are trying
to get the ball rolling on distributed social networking and such. Looks
interesting enough to give a shot, so I’ve reformatted this to be a

<p>Update 5/4: I’ve got an h-card, a rel=me link, and indieauth set up as an auth
provider. I’ve got these posts tagged as entries within an h-feed. However,
it’s still not entirely clear how this is supposed to work, mostly on the
client/consumer side of things. How does one put together a feed out of
individual people’s content? Allowing comments on here would be interesting
too, although probably not obvious considering the pages are static html.</p>
<p>Currently working on getting auth (via <a href="https://indieauth.com">https://indieauth.com</a>), microsub,
webmentions (via <a href="https://webmention.io">https://webmention.io</a>) and such up and running, as maybe
that’ll make thing clearer.</p>
<p>The webmentions system at <a href="https://telegraph.p3k.io">https://telegraph.p3k.io</a> doesn’t seem to like twitter

<div class="e-content"><p>I dive sidemount with a manifolded setup, and connect my first stages to the
manifold through quick-disconnects. I’ve recently switched to Swagelok QC-6 QDs
(another common alternative is Omniswivel), and was looking to attach some stem
and body protectors to my setup. Below is how I ended up attaching a loop of
cave line to a SS-QC6-SP.</p>
<p>There appear to be two variants of the SS-QC6-SP: one with a hole through the
side of the top, with a loop of steel rope through it, and one with a length of
steel rope riveted to the top surface. To attach cave line to the latter, drill
out the rivet head, push out the body using a hammer and awl, and thread a loop
through the resulting hole with knots on both sides to hold it in place. This
is easier to do with the cap removed from the body, but be prepared to use
force as there was thread lock on the set I received.</p>

</figure>
<p>The above image was captured with the same setup as below: 1 MSPS ADC w/ 500
kHz antialiasing filter, downsampled to 100 kSPS. A switchable bypass was added
around the CIC filter, however, allowing me to view a simple downsample without
filtering.</p>
<p>On the left, darker, is the measurement with CIC enabled, and on the right with
CIC bypassed. As you can see, signals 2, 4 and 5 are far stronger coming
through the bypass, suggesting they are higher frequencies aliased down into
this range. The scale of the spectrogram is 20 dB, so with CIC lobes as high as
16 dB this is perfectly possible. On the other hand, signal 1 seems unaffected,
however, so likely originates there. Signal 3 is hard to judge: it looks like a
faint VLF signal with a stronger higher-frequency signal - the one that
suddenly strengthens - aliased to just next to it.</p>
<p>Next step is to implement a multi-stage CIC filter with equalizer to further
reduce the aliasing. It might also be worth trying to pull out some of these
signals individually, aliased or not, as it looks like 4 might be modulated
with something.</p>

<div class="e-content"><p>As an experiment in VLF reception and SDR techniques, I hooked up a PmodAD1 to
my FPGA and started capturing. The short wire antenna goes into a JFET
amplifier, which is AC-coupled into the ADC. The AD1 can sample at 1 MSPS, but
as I’m reading data over a serial link limited to 1 MBaud, I use a CIC filter
to downsample the ADC’s output. On the PC, a python script performs an FFT and
draws a running spectrogram using SDL2.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, I’ve got an ATMega328p that runs at 18.432 MHz on only

<div class="e-content"><p>A company in China has produced a compact WiFi module for $5, available on
various sites and featured on Hack-A-Day. Documentation is in Chinese, but
there’s an active group trying to figure out how to flash the firmware to
customize the microcontroller software. As shipped, the module is flashed with
an AT command set that provides an IP stack, including DHCP and ICMP, that
offers up to four TCP or UDP connections. I’ve gotten mine working and
communicating, attached to my FPGA development board acting as a serial
pass-through.</p>
<p>Note that some of the translate documentation available online is already
obsolete. The baudrate was recently upped to 115200, for instance, and the
older docs don’t mention the reset pin that must be held high. I’ve also found
that if the board is in AP mode, a reset is required before it will switch to
station mode.</p>

implemented its communication protocol on my Nexys 3 to run some tests. It
appears that this chip is very sensitive to noise, either through the power
supply or coupled to the analog in line, as I’m getting very glitchy
measurements: with <em>analog_in</em> connected to Vcc/2, the output is 0x800 ± 0x20,
with every 20th measurement or so suddenly dropping to zero. This is when
powered off of an external 3.3 v linear regulator, as the results are far worse
when the Nexys’s 3.3 v supply is used.</p>
<p>The variation of the input measurement is understandable and not a huge issue,
as I expect that can be reduced with careful layout of the final board. The
sudden drops to zero are more worrying, however.</p>

<p>Problem solved, thanks to some
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=397774">help</a> from the
Chromium guys. It seems that if the OpenVPN <em>comp-lzo</em> option is set, an extra
byte is added to the packet even if this option is set to <em>no</em>. RouterOS
documentation states that LZO is not supported, but this means that the option
must be left out completely because otherwise the IP header will be received
shifted by one byte. I haven’t been able to find a breakdown of what exactly
the <em>comp-lzo</em> option changes in the OpenVPN packet, however.</p>
<p>A quick search showed that others have also run into this behavior, for
instance <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=152214">this</a> DD-WRT
thread. Another <a href="https://forums.openvpn.net/topic10067.html">thread</a> on the
OpenVPN forums suggests they are aware of the issue, but that it’s related to
the configuration and pushing of options and won’t be solved before version 3.</p>

<div class="byline"><a class="dt-published u-url" href="#20140724_chromeos_routeros_vpn">2014/07/24</a>
 - <a class="p-author h-card" href="http://www.thescrapyard.org">Jan-willem De Bleser</a>
</div>
<div class="e-content"><p>I’ve been trying to connect my Chromebook to a Mikrotik box via VPN, and
thougth I’d share some of my debugging results. This is not meant to be an
OpenVPN tutorial - there are plenty of those around - but will merely give what
is needed to make this particular setup work.</p>
<p>The main issue is that it seems that <strong>remote-cert-tls</strong> has been enabeled on
ChromeOS, which means that the server key must have the proper <em>Key Usage</em> and
<em>Extended Key Usage</em> extensions. Using the RouterOS
<strong>sign-certificate-request</strong> command will not set these, so a separate setup is
required. A certificate request can be created anywhere, including on RouterOS,
but to sign the key using OpenSSL you need to issue a command along the lines
of:</p>
<pre><code>openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -extensions v3_req -extfile ext.cnf -out server.crt
</code></pre>
<p>Note the <strong>-extensions</strong> and the <strong>-extfile</strong> arguments (thanks to
<a href="http://www.mytidbitz.com/?p=109">emeka</a>). The first tells x509 to go looking
in the <em>v3_req</em> section of <em>ext.cnf</em>, which is a standard OpenSSL configuration
file. Based on various online comments
(<a href="https://forums.openvpn.net/topic7484.html#p9220">here</a>, for instance), make
sure your <em>ext.cnf</em> file contains at least the following:</p>
<pre><code>[ v3_req ]

keyUsage = critical, digitalSignature, keyAgreement
extendedKeyUsage = critical, serverAuth
</code></pre>
<p>The specification for these two lines can be found
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/x509v3_config.html#Key_Usage_">here</a>. The
two <em>critical</em> arguments may not be necessary, but I haven’t tested that.</p>
<p>The second issue is that ChromeOS by default uses UDP for OpenVPN connections,
while RouterOS only supports TCP. This can be circumvented by creating an ONC
file to add the VPN connection rather than using the GUI under settings. I’ve
had some luck with the following (anonymized) file, the source of which I’ve
forgotten:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;UnencryptedConfiguration&quot;,

            &quot;X509&quot;: &quot;-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...-----END CERTIFICATE-----&quot;
        }
    ]
}

<p>See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/thescrapyard.org/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=Y2hyb21pdW0ub3JnfGRldnxneDo1ZDY0OGFhNGI2YzE0ZTgy">Open Network Configuration

document for a reference. The X509 certificate should be the PEM certificate
all on one line. Import this file via <em>chrome://net-internals/#chromeos</em>, and
you should have a new VPN connection configured.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to add and your CA certificate under Settings/Certificates, and
configure RouterOS as described <a href="http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/OpenVPN">here</a>.
This gets me as far as creating a successful connection, with both sides
assigned an IP, but neither side able to ping the other. I have yet to figure
out where the traffic is disappearing to.</p>

<div class="e-content"><p>Just acquired a Metcal soldering station, and the thing’s a real luxury
compared to what I’m used to. It soldered a connector to a Star MCPCB and then
some 1206 SMD capacitors to another PCB without a hitch.</p>
<p>For people unfamiliar with these (as I was until recently) they’re soldering
irons that use RF @ 13.56 MHz to directly heat the tip of the iron. It’s a
fixed-temperature system, with a heater welded to the tip so power transfer is
excellent. Apparently it can’t go out of calibration, and thanks to the good
power transfer you’d only really need temperature control if you were soldering
thermally sensitive components. The major downside is that the tips, or
“cartridges”, are noticeably more expensive than other tips.</p>
<p>A new MX station is very expensive, but you can get a second-hand setup for a
fairly reasonable price. The old RFG-30 supplies used in the STSS stations are
on eBay for $50–100, and they’re compatible with the modern MX hand-pieces and
cartridges. I got a supply from an STSS-002 and a new MX-H1-AV kit (hand-piece
and holder) and can confirm that they work together. The supply hums a bit, but
apparently that’s normal, and in fact you can tell how much power the tip’s
drawing by the intensity of the hum.</p>
<p>All in all, a nice piece of hardware.</p>
