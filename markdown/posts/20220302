My "networking closet" was a mess but is too narrow for a 19" rack, so I built
a 10" rack out of McMaster t-slot rails ([5537T35][1]) and hardware. It's
mounted to the wall using an L-shaped foot ([5537T571][2]) at the lower left
and a rearwards-extending segment of rail at the upper left, so quite sturdy.
The [5U rack strips][3] are attached unmodified using slot hardware, on
matching-length t-slot rails mounted such that the spacing between them can be
adjusted: not all "half-rack" hardware is exactly 10", I've found.

No space on the rack to mount power supplies, servers, or much in the way of
cable organizers, but at least the network hardware is now accessible and
somewhat organized.


Rack hardware, for reference:
* Mikrotik RB450Gx4 (router, DHCP, DNS, etc...)
* QNAP QSW-2104-2S (2.5GBASE-T switch, for NAS and office workstation)
* Mikrotik CSS610-8G-2S+IN (1GBASE-T switch, wanted a POE model but it didn't have SFP+)
* Uxcell 12-port keystone panel
* UTT S1042GP (POE switch, for APs)

Below the rack:
* Azulle Byte3 (NUC as lightweight FreeBSD server)
* Supermicro SYS-5029A-2TN4 (TrueNAS)

The in-wall cabling for APs (Ruckus R500 and Mikrotik wAP ac) and for my home
office terminates on the 12-port patch panel. The panel also connects to the printer
and to a HomeSeer RPI HomeTroller V3.
