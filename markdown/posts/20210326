I own a [Luceplan Berenice D12 LED](https://www.luceplan.com/products/berenice-table) table lamp. Very nice lamp
that has served me well for many years as both a desk and readling light, but recently it began to flicker.
The lamp has a warning that the bulb is not user-replaceable and the company didn't respond to my email,
so I took the lamp head apart to see what was up. The LED driver in the lamp head is a straightforward [L5970D](https://www.st.com/en/power-management/l5970d.html) step-down converter
set up for a constant 460 mA through a square ~1.5 cm LED. The flickering was due to
rows of the 5x5 emitter grid shutting off intermittently once warmed up, for whatever reason.

The existing passive components appeared to be in order so I removed the existing unmarked bulb (glued in place, twist to remove)
and replaced it with a [Cree CXA1507](https://www.cree.com/led-components/media/documents/XLampCXA1507.pdf).
The D12 heatsink has a slight recess for the LED and the Cree is slightly too large, so it's to be determined
if the thermal connection is good enough to prevent it from overheating. However, the driver voltage and light output is stable and the
Cree radiation pattern looks to work well with the lens cover of the D12, so thus far the repair is a success.
