I dive sidemount with a manifolded setup, and connect my first stages to the
manifold through quick-disconnects. I've recently switched to Swagelok QC-6 QDs
(another common alternative is Omniswivel), and was looking to attach some stem
and body protectors to my setup. Below is how I ended up attaching a loop of
cave line to a SS-QC6-SP.

There appear to be two variants of the SS-QC6-SP: one with a hole through the
side of the top, with a loop of steel rope through it, and one with a length of
steel rope riveted to the top surface. To attach cave line to the latter, drill
out the rivet head, push out the body using a hammer and awl, and thread a loop
through the resulting hole with knots on both sides to hold it in place. This
is easier to do with the cap removed from the body, but be prepared to use
force as there was thread lock on the set I received.
