Just acquired a Metcal soldering station, and the thing's a real luxury
compared to what I'm used to. It soldered a connector to a Star MCPCB and then
some 1206 SMD capacitors to another PCB without a hitch.

For people unfamiliar with these (as I was until recently) they're soldering
irons that use RF @ 13.56 MHz to directly heat the tip of the iron. It's a
fixed-temperature system, with a heater welded to the tip so power transfer is
excellent. Apparently it can't go out of calibration, and thanks to the good
power transfer you'd only really need temperature control if you were soldering
thermally sensitive components. The major downside is that the tips, or
"cartridges", are noticeably more expensive than other tips.

A new MX station is very expensive, but you can get a second-hand setup for a
fairly reasonable price. The old RFG-30 supplies used in the STSS stations are
on eBay for $50â€“100, and they're compatible with the modern MX hand-pieces and
cartridges. I got a supply from an STSS-002 and a new MX-H1-AV kit (hand-piece
and holder) and can confirm that they work together. The supply hums a bit, but
apparently that's normal, and in fact you can tell how much power the tip's
drawing by the intensity of the hum. 

All in all, a nice piece of hardware.
