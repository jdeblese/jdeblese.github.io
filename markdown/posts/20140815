I've mounted a Linear Devices [LTC2360](http://www.linear.com/product/LTC2360)
on a SOT23-6 breakout board (basic, no other on-board components) and
implemented its communication protocol on my Nexys 3 to run some tests. It
appears that this chip is very sensitive to noise, either through the power
supply or coupled to the analog in line, as I'm getting very glitchy
measurements: with *analog_in* connected to Vcc/2, the output is 0x800 Â± 0x20,
with every 20th measurement or so suddenly dropping to zero. This is when
powered off of an external 3.3 v linear regulator, as the results are far worse
when the Nexys's 3.3 v supply is used.

The variation of the input measurement is understandable and not a huge issue,
as I expect that can be reduced with careful layout of the final board. The
sudden drops to zero are more worrying, however.
