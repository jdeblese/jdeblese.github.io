<p>My build of the <a href="http://jenslabs.com/2014/08/02/hypno-jellyfish/">Hypno-Jellyfish</a> by Jenslabs. Modified with fiberoptic in the legs and an internal, USB-rechargeable lithium battery.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Check out Jenslabsâ€™s page <a href="http://jenslabs.com/2014/08/02/hypno-jellyfish/">here</a>. The short version is that he built a really cool plastic jellyfish out of thermoplastic and an Adafruit NeoPixel ring that glows and changes color when shaken. He built it for his daughter, and I decided to build one for my nephew. This page details the modifications I made.</p>

<h2 id="illuminated-tentacles">Illuminated Tentacles</h2>

<p>In an attempt to make the tentacles glow more, I formed them around some fine strands of fiberoptic cable. I picked up a 42-strand cable online, stripped out 14 strands, cut them to different lengths and wrapped them in thermoplastic. I tried to get side-glow fiberoptic, but apparently only the bundle as a whole glows significantly, so the tentacle is illuminated predominantly at the tips of the strands. You also have to get the light shining just right on the ends of the strands, of course.</p>
