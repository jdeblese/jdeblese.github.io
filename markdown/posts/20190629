Got a bike a few years back that I'm mostly very happy with (Fairdale
Weekender), except that I prefer the upright sitting position of a European city
bike to the more forward-leaning posture that the Archer handlebar put me in. I
finally decided to replace the handlebar with something more to my liking and
ended up purchasing the Nitto Bosco on a 105 mm Nitto HiRiser stem, which puts me
almost upright. Didn't much like the trigger shifter on this setup, so I
switched it out for a bar-end friction shifter instead.

One caveat: The SunRace R90 rear bar-end shifter is not entirely compatible with
the SRAM X5 9-speed rear derailer. The throw of the shifter is not enough to
pull the X5 from lowest to highest, so I've had to set it to shift from 2nd at
minimum to 8th at maximum. We'll see how well that works for commuting over the
next few weeks - whether I miss having the full range, and/or whether I should
switch it to 1-7 or 3-9.

Otherwise, I'll consider switching out the cassette to a 7-speed or switch to a
different derailer.
