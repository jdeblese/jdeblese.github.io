FreeBSD and Jellyfin

I've made another attempt at getting Jellyfin to run in a jail (see
[2020/03/13](#20200313_linjail)), since there's been progress on getting the
.NET core to build on FreeBSD (see
[github](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/issues/1139)). However,
although the bootstrap SDK starts in a FreeBSD jail, it still fails with
0x8007001F. Checking with _truss_,  it appears to be failing on an mlock of 4
KiB.

First point: it may be possible to get this running in the base FreeNAS
install. The SDK will run .NET executables in the base install if you set an
LD_LIBRARY_PATH pointing to the missing libraries (find them in a jail) and if
you increase _vm.max_wired_ to allow for the mlock. However, building now fails
with a .NET stack trace, one which I haven't yet tried to debug.

Second point: since mlock works in base, shouldn't it be possible to have it
work in a jail? Iocage has a jail property _allow_mlock_, but it seems this is
a no-op under 11.3, and only actually supported in FreeBSD 12. Thus, memory
locking will not work under the current stable version of FreeNAS.
