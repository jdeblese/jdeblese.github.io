I've managed to program an ATMega328p using my FPGA STK500 to communicate with
the ESP8266. The AT command set has some problematic limitations - not being
able to switch it off, for instance, so that command echoes are not interleaved
with incoming data - but it's good enough to broadcast sensor data over my
network. I'm looking forward to being able to hack the firmware, however.

Interestingly enough, I've got an ATMega328p that runs at 18.432 MHz on only
3.3 V, using an external 3.3 V crystal oscillator. That's out of spec according
to the data sheet, but works nonetheless.
